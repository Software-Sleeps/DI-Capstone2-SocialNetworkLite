# Social Network Lite

This project incorporated programming languages: React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We created wireframes using Adobe, Canva, and PhotoScape X to create mockups showing all of  the UI design of the application pages in order to have a solid foundation of what our application and API incorporation would look like as a final product.
